          <specific>1.1 identify purposes for listening in a variety of situations, formal and informal, and set personal goals related to listening tasks (e.g., to explore ideas in a book club discussion; to understand and empathize with a favourite character in a play; to express an opinion or offer advice to a partner during a peer conference)</specific>
          <specific>1.2 demonstrate an understanding of appropriate listening behaviour by using active listening strategies in order to contribute meaningfully and work constructively in groups (e.g., demonstrate an understanding of when to speak, when to listen, and how much to say; make connections between personal experiences and the contributions of other group members; ask relevant questions to clarify information and ideas)</specific>
          <specific>1.3 identify a variety of listening comprehension strategies and use them appropriately before, during, and after listening in order to understand and clarify the meaning of oral texts (e.g., list the important ideas in a poem or story read in class; ask questions to monitor understanding of an oral text; visualize and sketch to clarify understanding of an oral text) 
</specific>
          <specific>1.4 demonstrate an understanding of the information and ideas in a variety of oral texts by identifying important information or ideas and some supporting details (e.g., paraphrase a partner's reflections after a think-pair-share activity; paraphrase the important ideas in a play; engage in relevant dialogue after an oral presentation; create a poster/art work representing the important ideas in a poem or song) </specific>
          <specific>1.5 distinguish between stated and implied ideas in oral texts (e.g., distinguish between the actual words and the emphasis placed on them by the speaker) 
Teacher prompts: "How does the emphasis that the speaker places on specific words or phrases help you understand what is being said?" "Why do you think the speaker spoke those words so loudly?" "How does the way the speaker chooses to say words change the meaning of what he or she says?" </specific>
          <specific>1.6 extend understanding of oral texts by connecting the ideas in them to their own knowledge and experience; to other familiar texts, including print and visual texts; and to the world around them (e.g., brainstorm to connect a topic to their background knowledge of the topic; compare oral texts with similar themes from different cultures; connect messages in oral texts to social issues of relevance to the class)</specific>
          <specific>1.7 identify and explain the importance of significant ideas and information in oral texts (e.g., rank information in order of importance; compare key aspects of two oral texts using a Venn diagram; represent the main elements of an oral text on a web organizer or story map) </specific>
