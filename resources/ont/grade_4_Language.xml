          <specific>1.1 identify purposes for listening in a variety of situations, formal and informal, and set goals related to specific listening tasks (e.g., to summarize the theme of a small-group drama presentation; to record important details about an upcoming event announced on the radio; to clarify suggestions for improvements in a peer writing conference) 
</specific>
          <specific>1.2 demonstrate an understanding of appropriate listening behaviour by adapting active listening strategies to suit a variety of situations, including work in groups (e.g., demonstrate an understanding of when to speak, when to listen, and how much to say; summarize information and ideas from a small-group meeting; ask relevant questions to clarify meaning and link responses appropriately to the topic of conversation; adapt listening behaviour to the requirements of informal social settings and more formal settings) </specific>

          <specific>1.6 extend understanding of oral texts by connecting the ideas in them to their own knowledge, experience, and insights; to other texts, including print and visual texts; and to the world around them (e.g., relate the topic of an oral presentation to prior knowledge and information from personal experiences, articles, movies, stories, or television shows; ask questions about relevant stated and implied details; relate the ideas of other speakers in a dialogue group to their own experiences; use role play and drama to connect the themes and emotions depicted in an oral text to real-life situations) </specific>
          <specific>1.7 analyse oral texts and explain how specific elements in them contribute to meaning (e.g., ideas and information, body language, tone of voice) 
Teacher prompt: "How did the speaker's body language and tone of voice contribute to the meaning?" </specific>
          <specific>1.8 identify the point of view presented in oral texts and ask questions about possible bias (e.g., identify the use of words and/or phrases that signal generalizations or stereotypes about gender, culture, ability, or age)
