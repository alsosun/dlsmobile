        <specifics>
          <specific>1.1 identify purposes for listening in a variety of situations, formal and informal, and set personal goals for listening, initially with support and direction (e.g., to acquire information from a presentation by a guest speaker; to exchange ideas in a small-group discussion; to enjoy and understand poetry) </specific>
          <specific>1.2 demonstrate an understanding of appropriate listening behaviour by using active listening strategies in a variety of situations (e.g., demonstrate understanding of when to speak, when to listen, and how much to say; restate what the speaker has said and connect it to their own ideas; express personal interest in what has been said by asking related questions: I like what ______ said about ______) 
Teacher prompt: "When First Nations peoples use a talking stick,* a person speaks only when holding the talking stick, while the rest of the group listens. Today we are going to speak and listen in a similar way." </specific>
          <specific>1.3 identify several listening comprehension strategies and use them before, during, and after listening in order to understand and clarify the meaning of oral texts (e.g., listen for key words and phrases that signal important ideas; retell an oral text to a partner after a presentation; ask appropriate questions in order to make predictions about an oral text) 

</specific>
          <specific>1.4 demonstrate an understanding of the information and ideas in oral texts by retelling the story or restating the information, including the main idea and several interesting details (e.g., restate a partner's reflections after a think-pairshare activity; identify the important ideas in a group presentation; carry on a sustained conversation on a topic) </specific>
          <specific>1.5 use stated and implied information and ideas in oral texts to make simple inferences and reasonable predictions, and support the inferences with evidence from the text 
Teacher prompt: "You predicted _______. What clues from the oral text did you use to figure that out?" 

* Talking sticks were originally used by some First Nations peoples to ensure impartial and fair council meetings, but their use is becoming popular again in talking and sentencing circles. A person speaks only when holding the talking stick, while the rest of the group listens silently. 
</specific>
          <specific>1.6 extend understanding of oral texts by connecting the ideas in them to their own knowledge and experience; to other familiar texts, including print and visual texts; and to the world around them (e.g., talk about their own ideas and experiences related to the topic before listening; connect ideas from oral presentations to related school and community events and/or to other texts with similar topics or themes, including multicultural texts or texts in their own first language) </specific>
          <specific>1.7 identify words or phrases that indicate whether an oral text is fact or opinion, initially with support and direction (e.g., phrases such as I think...I feel... indicate an opinion rather than strictly factual information) 
</specific>
          <specific>1.8 identify, initially with support and direction, who is speaking in an oral text, and demonstrate an understanding that the speaker has his or her own point of view (e.g., people, events, and details are viewed differently by different people) 
Teacher prompts: "Does who is talking affect the way the information is presented or the way the story is told?" "How do you know what the speaker's feelings about the topic are? How does that affect you as a listener?" "How might the text change if [character X] were speaking instead?" </specific>
          <specific>1.9 identify some of the presentation strategies used in oral texts and explain how they influence the audience (e.g., the use of facial expressions helps the listener understand what is being said) 
Teacher prompts: "How does looking at the expression on a speaker's face help you to understand what is being said?" "Does the look on the speaker's face in some way change the meaning of the actual words being spoken?" </specific>
