        <overall_text>Creating and Presenting: apply the creative process (see pages 19-22) to the composition of movement sequences and short dance pieces, using the elements of dance to communicate feelings and ideas</overall_text>
        <specifics>
          <specific>A1.1	translate into dance a variety of movement sequences observed in nature (e.g., wind developing into a tornado; water freezing and melting on a landscape; rain transforming into a storm; a caterpillar evolving into a butterfly) 
	Teacher prompt: “How could your sequence of movements demonstrate the transformation of rain into a flood or a hurricane?”
</specific>
          <specific>A1.2	use dance as a language to explore and communicate ideas derived from a variety of literature sources (e.g., develop dance movements based on actions or emotions depicted in myths, short stories, legends from different cultures, picture books, or poetry)
	Teacher prompts: “What action words from the legend give us clues about the kinds of movements that would help tell the story through dance?” “How could you and your partner use dance to communicate the dilemma in a book such as The Great Kapok Tree?” “How would your dance change if you recreated it to reflect the perspective of a different character from the story?”</specific>
          <specific>A1.3	use narrative form to create short dance pieces on a variety of themes (e.g., a dance based on the theme of a quest or other type of journey; movements arranged [choreographed] to create a relationship [linking, parting] between some of the dancers)
	Teacher prompts: “How could your group create a dance piece inspired by one of the adventures of the Knights of the Round Table?” “How can you use choreography to give your dance an introduction, rising action, a climax, and resolution?” </specific>
          <specific>A1.4	use the elements of energy (e.g., collapse, explode, float) and time (e.g., duration, suddenness) in a dance piece to communicate an idea (e.g., show the journey of a balloon as it floats, explodes suddenly, and then collapses back to the floor)
	Teacher prompt: “How would repeating the same dance phrase but changing its quality (e.g., firm, light, vibratory), tempo (e.g., decreasing speed), or rhythm (e.g., erratic) affect the message you are trying to communicate to the audience?”</specific>

        <specifics>
          <specific>A2.1	demonstrate an understanding of how the language of dance can clarify and highlight ideas, images, and characters from familiar stories (e.g., explain how gestures and actions reveal and express the mood or personality or social position of a character)
	Teacher prompts: “What kinds of movements did the jester use in the dance piece we just saw (quality, level, speed)? What did they tell you about his or her point of view?” “How did interpreting the story through dance help you understand the story better?”</specific>
          <specific>A2.2	identify, using dance vocabulary, the elements of dance used in their own and others’ dance pieces and explain how each helps communicate ideas and feelings (e.g., symmetry/asymmetry [body] can reflect themes of unity and separation; sudden and sustained movements used sequentially can communicate the idea of a thunderstorm) 
	Teacher prompt: “One example of relationship I noticed in this dance was that the dancers danced the first movement really close together, and then they repeated it but moved far apart. What did this variation communicate about the theme of togetherness?”</specific>
          <specific>A2.3	identify and give examples of their strengths and areas for growth as dance creators and audience members (e.g., share with a small group what they did well, using dance terminology; explain what they need to practise to improve their ability to communicate through gesture and action) 
	Teacher prompt: “What movement or phrase did you use in your dance that was effective in creating meaning, and why do you think it was effective?” </specific>

        <specifics>
          <specific>A3.1	describe, with teacher guidance, how forms and styles of dance reflect people’s different social and political roles in various communities, times, and places (e.g., court dances in different countries in the 1500s and 1600s reflect the customs of the upper class [kings, queens, and people of the court] while country dances reflect the customs of the common people; carnival dances in Toronto, Brazil, New Orleans, and Cuba reflect various cultural traditions; martial arts disguised as capoeira dance reflects a response to oppression)</specific>
          <specific>A3.2	identify and describe the different roles of dance in their lives and in communities around the world (e.g., to socialize; for entertainment; to communicate and tell stories; to enrich the school experience [through a dance club]; to celebrate a good harvest year; as part of religious ceremonies) 
	Teacher prompts: “Based on the video we just saw, tell me one reason why dance is important to Aboriginal communities. Is this similar to why dance is important to you?” “Is it good for our school to have a lunchtime dance club? Why? How does it help us?”</specific>

          <specific>B1.2	demonstrate an understanding of the element of role by selectively using a few other elements of drama (e.g., time and place; relationship; focus and emphasis) to build belief in a role and establish its dramatic context
	Teacher prompts: “Show me, in role, (1) what is most important to the character you are playing; or (2) your favourite place to be; or (3) a person you rely upon; or (4) something that you feel you must do.” “What objects or props could you use to adapt the setting to emphasize your character’s occupation as a scientist?”</specific>
          <specific>B1.3	plan and shape the direction of the drama or role play by posing questions and working with others to find solutions, both in and out of role (e.g., In role: improvise possible solutions to a problem; Out of role: help select a drama form to represent the group’s idea)
	Teacher prompts: “What words or phrases can we contribute to role on the wall to deepen understanding of and belief in this character?” “What action will your character take to solve the problems he/she is facing?”</specific>
          <specific>B1.4	communicate thoughts, feelings, and ideas to a specific audience, using audio, visual, and/or technological aids to enhance their drama work (e.g., use dimmed lights, black lights, and music to suggest a mood; project images with an overhead/data projector; use a microphone to enhance or create sound effects or amplify narration [such as a spirit communication in an Aboriginal story])
	Teacher prompts: “How can you show the different meanings objects have in different contexts in everyday life (e.g., candles in ceremonies, birthdays, and festivals)?” “What objects could you use to symbolize who and what your character will miss on his/her journey?”</specific>

        <specifics>
          <specific>D1.1	create two- and three-dimensional works of art that express feelings and ideas inspired by their interests and experiences (e.g., a comic strip or a storyboard featuring a space voyage; an oil pastel drawing of peers in sports or dance poses; a painted still life of objects related to a hobby)
	Teacher prompts: “How can you make your classmates look as if they are participating in a sport? Can you ’freeze’ them in a dynamic sports pose? How can you position them to show them in action, as in Ken Danby’s goalie in At the Crease?” “How can you arrange and cluster the objects to create a focal point with the emphasis on the most important ones?”</specific>
          <specific>D1.2	demonstrate an understanding of composition, using selected principles of design to create narrative art works or art works on a theme or topic (e.g., a collaborative mural depicting a historical or an imaginary landscape in which objects and figures placed in the foreground create areas of emphasis, and objects placed in the background show diminishing size; a relief print of a seascape in which shapes that are similar, but are different in size or colour, give the work both unity and variety) 
	Teacher prompts: “How can you create emphasis in your art work by varying the value, width, and weight of your lines? In what other ways could you show emphasis?” “How can you repeat values of a colour in several places in your image to create unity?”</specific>
          <specific>D1.3	use elements of design in art works to communicate ideas, messages, and understandings (e.g., create a poster using colour and cropping of space to propose a solution to climate change; use contour lines of various weights in a charcoal gesture drawing of a person to capture the impression of movement; create a paper sculpture portrait of a favourite comic character that explores positive and negative space, using techniques of folding, scoring, fringing, and crimping)
	Teacher prompts: “How can you use contrast, emphasis, or variety to capture students’ attention and communicate your message?” “How would using recognizable symbols make your communication clearer or stronger?”</specific>
          <specific>D1.4	use a variety of materials, tools, and techniques to determine solutions to design challenges (e.g., 
	-drawing: make contour drawings of overlapping objects that are easily recognizable [e.g., a piece of fruit, a shoe, a glove, a pitcher], using soft graphite drawing pencils [e.g., primary printers] and depicting the objects from different points of view [e.g., from the front, the back, the side] 
	-mixed media: make a collage to depict a dream, using cut and torn paper, tissue paper, and found objects in contrasting shapes with a focus on positive and negative space
	-painting: use tempera paint and a range of monochromatic colour values to represent the emotional state of a character at a critical moment in a story that they have written or read
	-printmaking: use low-relief found objects [e.g., lace, textured leaves, and tin foil] to make a collograph in which texture and shape are used to create the composition, and embellish the final inked print with oil-pastel drawing 
	-sculpture: make a clay or papier mâché mask featuring exaggeration for dramatic effect and textures made by embossing, piercing, pinching, pressing, and/or scraping) 
	Teacher prompts: “From which point of view was it most challenging to draw that object? Why?” “How have you used monochromatic colour to create a mood in your painting?” “How can you increase the number of different textures that you can apply to the mask to give the surface more variety?”</specific>

	Teacher prompts: “If an artist such as David Blackwood changed the contrast and value in his prints, how might they suggest a different mood or feeling?” “How might different people experience and interpret the same object or image?” </specific>
          <specific>D2.2	analyse the use of elements and principles of design in a variety of art works, and explain how they are used to communicate meaning or understanding (e.g., the use of texture and negative space in Henry Moore’s abstract forms to suggest natural objects or figures; the use of tints and shades to explore vivid colour in Alma Thomas’s aerial view paintings; the use of bright colours and rounded shapes in children’s advertising to get their attention and convey a friendly feeling) 
	Teacher prompts: “How important are negative shapes in an art work? Why?” “What message is the artist conveying by distorting and abstracting the subject?” “Who is the poster directed towards? How has the artist used different elements to appeal to his or her audience?”</specific>
