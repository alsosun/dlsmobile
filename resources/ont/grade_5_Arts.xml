          <specific>D1.1	create two- and three-dimensional art works that express feelings and ideas inspired by their own and others’ points of view (e.g., a painting based on a photo montage about children’s rights and responsibilities; a coloured line drawing of an underwater setting or the view from an airplane that addresses environmental awareness by showing the interconnectedness of ecosystems; a painting of someone in a particular situation in which empathy for him or her is created through characterization)
	Teacher prompts: “How can you use size and shape in your painting to express your feelings or point of view about the importance of the different images in your montage?” “How does our impression of the world change when we look at it from a bird’s-eye view rather than a worm’s-eye view? How can you use a particular point of view in your painting (not necessarily these) to create a particular impression?”</specific>
          <specific>D1.2	demonstrate an understanding of composition, using selected principles of design to create narrative art works or art works on a theme or topic (e.g., create an abstract painting using different proportions of complementary colours; create a simple sculpture of a human form that depicts an emotional response and shows awareness of proportion and negative space [in the style of Barbara Hepworth]; create an impression of depth and space by neutralizing colour intensity and brightness in a landscape painting [atmospheric perspective])
	Teacher prompts: “How have you used colour to create a point of emphasis and a sense of space?” “How will you use your in-class sketches of student poses to help you decide on the emotion to express with the position of the figure?” “How did you dull the colours to show things that are in the distance?” </specific>
          <specific>D1.3	use elements of design in art works to communicate ideas, messages, and understandings (e.g., a series of three relief prints that use a glue-line relief print process to illustrate the beginning, middle, and end of a story; a poster that presents solutions to stereotyping, bias, or bullying, using angle of view; a graffiti-style mural that addresses a community issue, using convex shapes that lead the eye with implied lines)

How did the use of proportion and scale change your message when your poster had faces that were larger than life?” “Which elements and principles of design did you use to focus and simplify the text and image in the mural? How did you use gradations of value to create the illusion of depth in your designs?”</specific>
          <specific>D1.4	use a variety of materials, tools, and techniques to determine solutions to design challenges (e.g.,
	-drawing: coloured pencils to create a caricature of a celebrity that exaggerates facial features and uses linear shading and cast shadows
	-mixed media: a composite image that uses photographs, photocopies, transfers, images, and selected opaque and transparent materials to reflect their self-identity
	-painting: tempera paint or watercolour pencils using unusual colours or perspectives to suggest a fantasy world
	-printmaking: a relief print transferred from a textured surface, made with glue lines, craft foam, cardboard, paper, or string glued to board, using shapes to create a graphic design that explores pattern in a non-objective op art style
	-sculpture: a human figure or an imaginary creature made from clay, using basic hand-building methods such as making the piece with coils or slabs of clay or by pinching and pulling the clay)

          <specific>D2.1	interpret a variety of art works and identify the feelings, issues, themes, and social concerns that they convey (e.g., use an image round-table technique to compare interpretations of emotions suggested by abstract forms or figures in art work; sort and classify a variety of art images, such as Nigerian, Egyptian, Mayan, and Chinese sculptures, to determine common subjects or themes)
	Teacher prompts: “When you look at how Constantin Brancusi makes the human form abstract in his sculptures, what do the shapes remind you of?” “What different emotions does the pose of this art work suggest to you? If the figure in the art work could come to life, what would it say to you?” “How is proportion used to convey importance?”</specific>
          <specific>D2.2	explain how the elements and principles of design are used in their own and others’ art work to communicate meaning or understanding (e.g., packaging designs [cereal boxes, drink packaging] that use complementary colours create an impression different from that created by packages that use other colour schemes; Alexander Calder’s mobiles and Piet Mondrian’s paintings use colour, line, and geometric shape to create an impression of movement; colour, line, and pattern are used to convey a story in the illuminated manuscript of the Ramayana) 
	Teacher prompts: “How does the use of colour engage the viewer and help sell the product? Which colour scheme do you think is most effective in persuading the buyer, and why?” “How does Mondrian’s Broadway Boogie Woogie use colour, line, and shape to create an impression of movement?” “How have artists arranged shapes, lines, patterns, and colours to create a sense of order and rhythm?” “How do the details on the characters help the viewer focus on and understand the story?”</specific>
          <specific>D2.3	demonstrate an understanding of how to read and interpret signs, symbols, and style in art works (e.g., Carl Ray’s paintings use symbols in the Woodland style of Aboriginal art to tell a story; Picasso’s cubist portraits use stylistic features from African masks; a tiger is used in Asian art to signify bravery)
