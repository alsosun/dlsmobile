          <specific>* explain how differences between First Nation peoples and early European explorers led to conflicts between the two groups (e.g., lack of common language, differing world views and spiritual beliefs, introduction of European diseases, differing views about property ownership);</specific>
          <specific>* express their personal viewpoints, based on historical evidence, about the outcomes of early contact between First Nation peoples and early European explorers (e.g., report on the origins and challenges of the Métis Nation; use a storyboard to show the events leading to the establishment and destruction of Ste-Marie-Among-the-Hurons; present the results of an Internet search on a specific Hudson's Bay Company or North West Company trading post).</specific>
