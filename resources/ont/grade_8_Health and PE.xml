        <overall_text>participate actively and regularly in a wide variety of physical activities, and demonstrate an understanding of how personal motivational factors can be used to encourage participation in physical activity</overall_text>
        <specifics>
          <specific>A1.1 actively participate according to their capabilities in a wide variety of program activities (e.g., individual, small-group, and large-group activities; movement and rhythmic activities; dance; outdoor pursuits) [PS, IS] 

Teacher prompt: “In the next ten minutes, you will have the opportunity to go to three different fitness stations. Think about what stations you will choose to visit.”

Student: “I am going to pick two stations that connect to my fitness goals and one for fun. I am going to go to the exercise band station because I need to work on my arm strength. I am going to go to the stability ball station because I am working on my core strength and balance. I’m going to pick skipping as my third station because my friend and I are having a contest to see who can skip rope the longest without stopping.”
</specific>
          <specific>A1.2 demonstrate an understanding of factors that contribute to their personal enjoyment of being active (e.g., being able to adapt activities to suit individual needs and preferences; having a choice of activities and choices within activities; being comfortable with the activities, both socially and emotionally; being able to take part in activities in a natural environment; being able to take part in activities that are culturally relevant), as they participate in a diverse range of physical activities in a variety of indoor and outdoor environments [PS] 

Teacher prompt: “In class, we play in different groups to experience working with different people who have different skill levels. What kinds of groups do you find most comfortable to participate in?”

Student: “I’m comfortable playing with people who are at my skill level, but I also like playing with people who are better than I am, because it gives me a good challenge and I can learn from playing with them.” 

Teacher prompt: “Activities are more enjoyable when you can play at a level that is challenging but still not too difficult. How does this badminton activity do this?”

Student: “With this activity, you can choose to serve the shuttle from any of three lines. If you choose the distance that allows you to get the shuttle over the net most of the time and into one of the three areas marked on the floor with pylons, then you are choosing the distance that is not too easy and not too hard.”
</specific>
          <specific>A1.3 demonstrate an understanding of factors that motivate personal participation in physical activities every day (e.g., gaining health benefits, including release from stress; having interpersonal interactions; becoming more independent in daily living activities; experiencing personal enjoyment), and explain how these factors can be used to influence others (e.g., friends, family, members of the community) to be physically active [CT] 

Teacher prompt: “How can your participation in physical activity have an impact on others?”

Students: “By being active, you can be a good role model and influence others. At school I am a fitness buddy for a Grade 2 student. Our classes get together and we help the younger students participate in physical activities.” “Sometimes just by participating, you can motivate others to join you. Because I play water polo, my younger sister wants to try it.” “On the weekends when I go for a bike ride, my father often comes with me. He might not go out on his own if I were not going.”</specific>

        <specifics>
          <specific>A2.1 Daily physical activity (DPA): participate in sustained moderate to vigorous physical activity, with appropriate warm-up and cool-down activities, to the best of their ability for a minimum of twenty minutes each day (e.g., capture the flag, four-corner soccer, ball fitness activities) [PS]</specific>
          <specific>A2.2 recognize the difference between health-related components of personal fitness (i.e., cardiorespiratory endurance, muscular strength, muscular endurance, flexibility) and skill-related components (i.e., balance, agility, power, reaction time, speed, and coordination), and explain how to use training principles to enhance both components [CT] 

Teacher prompt: “How do you use training principles, such as considering the frequency and intensity of your workout and the timing and types of activities you choose, to improve your health-related fitness, particularly cardiorespiratory fitness? What does Canada’s Physical Activity Guide for Youth recommend?”

Student: “I need to decide what activities to do, and how often and how long I need to be active to get the fitness benefits I want. To improve my cardiorespiratory fitness, I need to choose activities that will raise my heart rate and make my heart and lungs work harder. Doing something like swimming for forty minutes three days a week, for example, would improve my cardiorespiratory fitness. The physical activity guide recommends that young people improve their fitness by increasing the time they currently spend on physical activity each day and reducing non-active time.” 

Teacher prompt: “Health-related components of fitness contribute to your overall health and well-being. Skill-related components of fitness help improve the quality of your movements during activity. Agility is a skill-related component of fitness. Explain what agility is. Why is it important?”

Student: “Agility is the ability to change directions and change smoothly and easily from one movement to another. It is helpful when playing sports like soccer or basketball but also when participating in recreational activities like in-line skating or skateboarding. Having good agility helps you move more smoothly and efficiently and makes the activity more fun.”
</specific>
          <specific>A2.3 assess their level of health-related fitness (i.e., cardiorespiratory endurance, muscular strength, muscular endurance, flexibility) during various physical activities and monitor changes in fitness levels over time (e.g., by tracking heart rates, recovery time, how they feel during and after activity, level of participation; noting increase in range of motion when doing yoga stretches; tracking increases in the number of repetitions when doing arm curls with exercise bands) [PS, CT] 

Teacher prompt: “How has monitoring your work on different fitness components Zhelped improve your fitness?”

Student: “Seeing improvements over time has given me encouragement to keep working and become even more fit. Tracking my progress on different components has also helped me focus on those that need more work, so my overall fitness has become better.”
</specific>
          <specific>A2.4 develop, implement, and revise a personal plan to meet short- and long-term health-related fitness and physical activity goals [PS, CT] 

Teacher prompt: “What have you chosen as your goal? When setting your goal and developing your plan to achieve it, consider your time frame as well as your assessment information. Is your goal short-term or long-term? How do you know that your goal is realistic? How will you know whether you’ve achieved your goal? What will help you achieve your goal? How will achieving this goal help you?”

Student: “I’m working at improving my long-distance running/wheeling to improve my overall fitness. I want to run/wheel the 1500-metre event at the track meet in the spring. I am also thinking of doing a 10K charity run/wheel. I think my goal is realistic. It is October, so this is a long-term goal - and I have time to train. And I did complete the 1500-metre event last year, although it was fairly challenging. Here is my plan to accomplish my goal: I plan to practise three times a week for the next ten weeks. And if I work with a partner, I think I will be more successful, because my partner can give me tips, suggestions, and encouragement. I can also talk with my partner about my plan and consider whether I need to change anything I am doing. I don’t have a goal to complete the race in any set time. Finishing the race will be my goal. I will definitely be more fit and I will be really proud of myself if I can do this.”

        <specifics>
          <specific>A3.1 demonstrate behaviours and apply procedures that maximize their safety and that of others (e.g., following appropriate procedures and guidelines; demonstrating social responsibility; encouraging others to act safely; wearing sunscreen, long sleeves, sunglasses, and a hat to limit UV exposure) in a variety of physical activity settings (e.g., school, community recreational facilities, outdoor recreational venues) [PS, IS] 

Teacher prompt: “Other than school facilities, what are some local indoor and outdoor recreational venues in our community that we can use for physical activities? What safety considerations do you need to think about, whether you are participating in physical activity at school or in the community?”

Student: “We have several parks, including a skateboard park, as well as fields, hiking trails, bike paths, a rink, and a lake that is close by. Wherever we participate in physical activities, we need to be aware of ourselves and others in our surroundings. Different activities have specific safety considerations and rules that we need to think about and follow. We also need to use and wear the proper safety equipment for these activities. Using good judgement, thinking for yourself, following posted rules and signs, and thinking before you act are good general guidelines.”
</specific>
          <specific>A3.2 demonstrate a basic understanding of how to deal with emergency situations that may occur while participating in physical activity (e.g., remain calm, know when more help is needed or when to call 9-1-1, know where to get more help, know how to recognize symptoms of asthma or anaphylaxis, move objects that may be a safety hazard away from the injured person, know what an automated external defibrillator (AED) is and be aware of where they are located in community facilities) [PS, CT]</specific>

        <specifics>
          <specific>B1.1 perform smooth transfers of weight and rotations, in relation to others and equipment, in a variety of situations involving static and dynamic balance (e.g., display control while stepping and turning on and off steps during an aerobic routine; move smoothly between positions and twists during a Pilates activity; work with a partner to create a sequence that involves holding a partner’s partial or whole weight when transfer ring from one balance to another) [PS, IS] 

Teacher prompt: “Create a series of tableaux that demonstrates the different phases of your favourite physical activity, such as the three phases involved in sprinting or in swinging a cricket bat, showing how you get ready, showing the action itself, and showing the follow-through. Be sure to show three distinct movements and a smooth transition from each movement to the next.”</specific>
          <specific>B1.2 perform a wide variety of locomotor movements, with and without equipment, while responding to a variety of external stimuli (e.g., approach, take off, and land when doing a triple jump into a pit; strive to beat a time record in orienteering; choreograph a dance sequence in response to music; perform step aerobics at different tempos; change styles of cross-country skiing depending on snow and terrain conditions, using a skate technique on open, flat sections and a classic technique on narrower trails) [PS] 

Teacher prompt: “How might you modify the movements in your dance sequence as the music changes or as you develop new movement sequences using different types of music?”

Student: “With slower, more lyrical music, my movements would be slower and bigger. With fast music, I would use quicker and stronger steps in response to the fast tempo.”</specific>
          <specific>B1.3 use and combine sending, receiving, and retaining skills in response to a variety of external stimuli, while applying basic principles of movement* (e.g., shift weight and use all joints for maximum force when throwing against the wind; put an appropriate spin on the ball when throwing a football or rolling a ball around an obstacle in front of a target; sprint to catch a pass that has been thrown short to an open space away from defenders; while moving to music, transfer a rhythmic gymnastics ball from one hand to the other, using the momentum of the movement to hold on to the ball; show awareness of others’ positions when taking off and landing in a basketball layup; move body to retain an object in flag tag while evading defenders; keep the basketball on their lap while moving and evading a defender in wheelchair basketball) [PS, IS] 

Teacher prompt: “How will you adjust for the wind when throwing an object?”

Student: “I will need to throw harder or softer, or adjust my aim, depending on the direction of the wind.”</specific>
          <specific>B1.4 demonstrate an understanding of the phases of movement (i.e., preparation, execution, followthrough) and apply this understanding to the refinement of movement skills in a variety of physical activities (e.g., assume a ready position, swing, and follow through in a badminton stroke; reach, pull, and recover when doing the back crawl) [PS] 

Teacher prompt: “How does the preparation phase for sprinting differ from the preparation phase for cross-country running?”

Student: “With sprinting, you stay low to the ground and prepare to explode from the start. With cross-country running, you want to start in more of an upright position, and you start more slowly because you want to conserve energy and pace yourself all the way through the run.”

        <specifics>
          <specific>B2.1 demonstrate an understanding of the components of a range of physical activities (e.g., movement skills, game structures, basic rules and guidelines, conventions of fair play and etiquette), and apply this understanding as they participate in a variety of physical activities in indoor and outdoor environments [IS, CT] 

Teacher prompt: “Working in your small group, consider what rule you could change in this activity to make it more or less challenging.”

Student: “When playing ultimate disc, we could change the rules so that everyone has to throw with their non-dominant hand. That gives everyone good practice and also makes the play a little more equal because it makes it challenging for everyone.” 

Teacher prompt: “Now change the activity again, considering how you might adapt the activity for a person in your group who has different needs; for example, you may adapt the activity for someone who doesn’t understand the language or someone who may not understand the rules of the activity.”

Student: “We might change the rules to make it a lot simpler - for example, we would not worry about the rules about the number of seconds you can hold the disc or the number of steps you are allowed to take with the disc. Once everyone seems to understand the game, we could add those rules back in. Or we might play the game with a person who needs help paired up with a more experienced player, or with everyone working in pairs, so people can help each other follow the game. In this variation, both players would handle the disc - for example, one catches it and the other throws it - before it goes on to another pair.”</specific>
          <specific>B2.2 demonstrate an understanding of how movement skills, concepts, and strategies are transferable across different physical activities within various categories* (e.g., individual, target, net/wall, striking/fielding, territory), and identify skills, concepts, and strategies that they found effective while participating in a variety of physical activities in different categories [CT] 

Teacher prompt: “Think about activities you do at school and those you do on your own time. How can knowing how to do an activity well affect your performance in that activity and in other activities?”

Students: “At school, we did cross-country running. I also go running sometimes at home. Learning how to pace myself when I run has made it a lot easier for me to run in my neighbourhood.” “We worked on our stability and balance when we did fitness and developmental gymnastics at school. My balance has improved and that has helped me with trail riding when I am working on strategies for riding over logs and bumps. The better I get, the more confident I get and the more I am able to do. I can also use the skills, like balance, and the strategies, like ways of negotiating bumps and jumps, when I do other activities, like skateboarding.” 

Teacher prompt: “What are some common elements of a variety of individual activities, such as yoga, qigong, and track and field? What about common elements among team sports such as soccer, rugby, and softball?”

Student: “Activities like yoga and qigong involve core strength, balance, and flexibility. Paying attention to breathing is also really important. There is also a certain etiquette that you should follow in these activities - for example, you shouldn’t talk while doing the activity. You should focus on your own practice. In team activities like soccer, rugby, and softball, you use sending, receiving, and carrying skills. You need an understanding of the basic rules. You need to be aware of the boundaries and work together as a team.”</specific>
          <specific>B2.3 apply a variety of tactical solutions to increase chances of success as they participate in physical activities (e.g., individual activities: use conscious breathing to enhance movement during a fitness activity; toss balls or beanbags in an even pattern and keep eyes focused at the peak of the toss when learning to juggle with three objects; target activities: position balls or rocks in a place that makes it difficult for the opposing team to score in games such as bocce or curling; net/wall activities: choose the type of shot and consider the placement of the shot to gain an offensive advantage; striking/ fielding activities: send the object away from the defenders to allow for more time to score before the fielders retrieve the object; territory activities: send a pass that places the object closer to the goal; keep their body between the object and the defender while moving; practise using a fast transition from offence to defence) [IS, CT]**</specific>

          <specific>C1.1 demonstrate an understanding of different types of nutrients (e.g., macronutrients and micronutrients) and their functions 

Teacher prompt: “Different kinds of nutrients are needed to achieve optimal health and prevent disease. Nutrients can be divided into two types - macronutrients and micronutrients. What are these, and why is each kind of nutrient needed for good health?”
</specific>
          <specific>C1.2 identify situations that could lead to injury or death (e.g., head injuries in contact sports, spinal cord injuries from falls or diving into unknown water, injuries in car accidents) and describe behaviours that can help to reduce risk (e.g., wearing protective gear, especially helmets; thinking before acting; avoiding conflicts that could lead to violence; avoiding diving into unknown water; being cautious when driving or riding ATVs, tractors, boats, or snowmobiles; being aware of food safety when cooking and preparing food) [CT] 

Teacher prompt: “Unintentional injury is a leading cause of death for children and youth in Canada. Adolescents need to be aware of the potential results associated with higher-risk activities. What are some possible consequences of injuries to the spinal cord or head?”

Student: “Spinal cord injuries can cause complete or partial paralysis. Severe head injuries can cause brain damage that may result in impairments of movement, sight, hearing, speech, cognitive functioning, or sensation or that may even lead to death.” Substance Use, Addictions, and Related Behaviours
</specific>
          <specific>C1.3 identify and describe the warning signs of substance misuse or abuse, addictions, and related behaviours (e.g., changes in behaviour, gradual withdrawal from social circles, a drop in academic performance) and the consequences that can occur (e.g., aggressive behaviours related to alcohol use that can lead to gender-based violence, dating violence, or sexual assault; financial problems resulting from online gambling; overdose as a result of misuse of prescription medications, including pain relievers; inability to make good decisions as a result of drug use; binge drinking and alcohol poisoning; injury, death, or legal charges resulting from accidents caused by impaired driving; selfharming behaviours, including cutting, related to mental illnesses such as depression that are exacerbated by substance abuse; fetal alcohol spectrum disorder [FASD] in children as a result of alcohol abuse by the mother during pregnancy)

          <specific>C2.1 evaluate personal food choices on the basis of a variety of criteria, including serving size, nutrient content, energy value, and ingredients (e.g., fats, carbohydrates, protein, vitamins and minerals, calories, additives, allergens), preparation method, and other factors that can affect health and well-being [CT] 

Teacher prompt: “Why is paying attention to nutrients more valuable than counting calories?”

Student: “Paying attention to nutrients helps you focus on eating in a balanced way. Calories are only one thing to consider and, by themselves, don’t provide information about nutrition. By following Canada’s Food Guide, I can make sure that I am meeting my energy and nutrient needs. It’s important to get all of the different nutrients that my body needs. By considering nutrient content, I can make sure I get enough vitamins and minerals - for example, I need to eat orange vegetables like carrots and orange peppers to get Vitamin A. And if I make soup with milk instead of water, I’ll get more calcium and Vitamin D.”

Teacher: “Serving size is one thing to consider when making food choices. How many servings of fruits and vegetables are recommended for teenagers?” Student: “Canada’s Food Guide recommends that teens eat seven to eight servings of vegetables and fruit per day.” 

Teacher prompt: “If you do not eat breakfast, how does that affect how you feel during the day?”

Student: “I feel sluggish in the morning, and I’m starving by ten o’clock. When I’m so hungry, I’m more likely to eat less nutritious food at break.” </specific>
          <specific>C2.2 demonstrate the ability to assess situations for potential dangers (e.g., getting into a car with a stranger or an impaired, unlicensed, or inexperienced driver; dependencies or coercion in dating relationships; joining gangs; participating in violence; attending a party where alcohol or drugs are being used; using cosmetic procedures or treatments such as piercing, tattooing, crash diets, or artificial tanning that involve potential health risks), and apply strategies for avoiding dangerous situations [CT] 

Teacher prompt: “What are some things you could do instead of getting into a car with a driver who has been drinking?” Student: “I could call a family member or friend, stay over where I am, walk home with a friend if there is a safe route, or take a bus or taxi if one is available. I should have a plan and, if I can, carry money or a phone, so that I do not have to depend on someone else to get home safely.” 

Teacher prompt: “What are some things to be aware of in a relationship to keep yourself safe?”

Student: “Thinking about what makes a relationship healthier is a good start. Things that could lead to danger in relationships include an uneven balance of power in the relationship and situations that involve alcohol or drugs. I can stay safer by defining my own limits, listening to my gut feelings, and letting others know what I am doing and where I am going. If something does not feel good or right, I need to have the confidence to tell the other person to stop immediately.”</specific>
          <specific>C2.3 explain how stress affects mental health and emotional well-being, and demonstrate an understanding of how to use a variety of strategies for relieving stress and caring for their mental health (e.g., engaging in physical activity, listening to music, resting, meditating, talking with a trusted individual, practising smudging) [PS] 

Teacher prompt: “Maintaining good mental health and emotional well-being involves balancing the different aspects of life: the physical, intellectual, social, emotional, and spiritual. It involves the ability to think, feel, act, and interact in a way that allows you to enjoy life and cope with challenges that arise. Signs of potential mental health difficulties can include being frequently sad or depressed, anxious, or rebellious; having difficulty paying attention; having problems with eating, sleeping, or getting along at school; or being addicted to substances. Everyone is vulnerable to emotional or mental stresses. What can you do to take care of your mental health?”

Student: “Being aware of my feelings and monitoring them can help. So can understanding that anyone can experience mental health difficulties and that getting help makes a big difference.” 

Teacher prompt: “Stress can be positive and negative. Stress can motivate you to get things done, but it is also connected to things over which you have less control, like illness, death, or divorce, financial concerns, or environmental issues. Identify a situation in which students often feel stressed. How can you manage stress effectively?”

Student: “Students often feel stressed when they have too much to do. To cope, you need to plan your time and set priorities. Do the most important things first. Include some time for taking breaks and being active. Check off what you get done as you do it. Plan with a friend, if that helps you. Stress can be managed or relieved in many ways. Some people find that taking some personal time to reflect and think and do quiet things like rest, write, read, meditate, or listen to music works best for them. Others find that being physically active or interacting with others by talking through problems is helpful. Different things work for different people, and you have to find the way that works best for you. Some cultures have special ways of relieving stress. Some First Nation people, for example, use smudging to relieve stress. This is a practice in which people fan smoke from herbs like sage or sweetgrass over their bodies to cleanse them of bad feelings and get rid of negative thoughts and energy. Afterwards, they feel renewed, physically, emotionally, mentally, and spiritually.”</specific>

Teacher prompt: “How could you promote healthy eating at home?”

Student: “I could help with meal planning, shopping, and preparation, or discuss healthy eating with my family.”

Teacher: “Where can you get more information about healthy eating in your community?”

Student: “The public health unit, registered dieticians, medical clinics, family health centres, and reputable websites are all good sources of information about healthy eating.”

Teacher: “What might you do to promote healthy eating at school?”

Student: “I could ask about healthy food policies and join clubs or groups to support healthy eating at school. I could model healthy eating. As a class, we could put together information about healthier food choices to share with younger students. Instead of selling chocolates to raise funds, we could do something healthy like have a dance-a-thon.”

Teacher prompt: “Managing emotions in heated situations is an essential skill. Consider this situation: Students are playing basketball on the playground; someone gets pushed aggressively and tempers flare. What is the impact on those playing and those watching?”

Student: “This situation could escalate into a fight. Someone could be hurt, and that could lead to suspension or assault charges and damage the relationships between the players on and off the court and in the classroom. It could scare or injure the people watching.” 

Teacher prompt: “Gender-based violence includes any form of behaviour - psychological, physical, and sexual - that is based on an individual’s gender and is intended to control, humiliate, or harm the individual. When we say ‘gender-based violence’, we are often referring to violence against women and girls. Can you give me some examples?”

Student: “It can include physical assault in a relationship, sexual assault, or rape. It can also include things like having your rear end pinched in the hallway, having your top pulled down or lifted up, or being held down and touched.”</specific>
