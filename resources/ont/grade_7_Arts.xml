        <specifics>
          <specific>A1.1	create dance pieces to represent or respond to specific rhythms and pieces of music (e.g., use the body, body parts, and the floor [stamping, stepping, body slapping] to replicate the rhythms in the music; transform a music imaging exercise into a dance interpretation) 
	Teacher prompt: “While listening to this piece of music, record on paper words, pictures, and shapes that come to mind and think of how you can translate these abstract images into movement.”</specific>
          <specific>A1.2	use dance as a language to communicate ideas from their own writing or media works (e.g., create a dance piece inspired by a student-authored poem about relationships with the natural world or by a student media work about divorce or loss)
	Teacher prompts: “What are some images from your poem that you could represent in dance? How would you do so?” “What elements of dance (e.g., movements, levels, pathways) would best communicate the different perspectives presented in your writing or media presentation?”</specific>
          <specific>A1.3	use theme and variations in a variety of ways when creating dance pieces (e.g., create a simple movement phrase [theme] and then repeat it in modified form [variation] using choreographic manipulations [retrograding the original phrase, facing another dancer, adding more dancers])
	Teacher prompts: “What new manipulation that we haven’t explored yet could you use to create another variation on the original phrase (theme)?” “Can we use the same set of movements to show bullying from the perspective of a variety of people? How will the movements have to change to show the different perspectives? Show me.”</specific>
          <specific>A1.4	use the elements of dance and choreographic forms (e.g., pattern forms, narrative forms) to communicate a variety of themes or moods (e.g., use entrances or exits to communicate beginnings or endings; use a recurring sequence of movements to signal a particular mood or character; use canon form for emphasis)
	Teacher prompt: “What message could be conveyed by a repeated pattern? What message might be conveyed when you interrupt a repeated pattern?”</specific>

        <specifics>
          <specific>A2.1	construct personal interpretations of the messages in their own and others’ dance pieces, including messages about issues relevant to their community and/or the world (e.g., dance pieces on topics such as urban sprawl, land claims, poverty, homophobia, homelessness), and communicate their responses in a variety of ways (e.g., through writing, class discussion, oral reports, song, drama, visual art)
	Teacher prompt: “What statement did the dance we just watched make about global warming? Do you agree or disagree with the message the dance conveyed? Why? Was the message effectively conveyed?”</specific>
          <specific>A2.2	analyse, using dance vocabulary, their own and others’ dance pieces to identify the elements of dance and the choreographic forms used in them and explain how they help communicate meaning (e.g., use of crouching shapes low to the ground and bound energy communicates the idea of confined space; use of site-specific locations [outdoor playground] to structure a dance communicates the idea of connection to the environment) 
	Teacher prompts: “How did the use of the canon form emphasize the message of the dance piece?” “How did the fact that the dancers performed in theatre in the round help reinforce their message of confinement?” </specific>
          <specific>A2.3	identify and give examples of their strengths and areas for growth as dance creators, interpreters, and audience members (e.g., share with a partner what they did well during a performance, using dance vocabulary; use a concept map to explain their choice of dance movements) 
	Teacher prompts: “When creating dance pieces, do you prefer to translate literature into dance or to use themes and ideas of your own? Why?” “As an audience member, what do you look for to help you understand what is being said? The dancers’ body actions, perhaps? What other elements? Do you think your interpretations are usually accurate? Can you give an example when you showed particularly good understanding of the dancers’ message?”

        <specifics>
          <specific>A3.1	describe the evolution of dance and performance as different groups of people have responded to external factors such as migration, a new environment, and/or contact with other groups or cultures (e.g., the evolution of Maritime Acadian folk dances into Louisiana Cajun dances such as fais do do and the Mardi Gras dance Krewes; the origins and development of French and Scottish jigs; the evolution of the Métis jig out of imitations of wildlife movements [prairie wild birds] and the intricate footwork of Native dancing and European jigs)
	Teacher prompt: “How did the dances of the Acadians evolve when they were forced to immigrate to Louisiana? What factors influenced this evolution?”</specific>
          <specific>A3.2	identify ways in which dance and its depictions in the media may influence a person’s character development and sense of identity (e.g., by influencing young people’s sense of themselves and their bodies; by providing dance role models who represent or promote particular lifestyles, values, and attitudes)
	Teacher prompts: “How has the way the media depict dance influenced the way you feel about your own dancing?” “How has dance in the media influenced your body image?” “Are the traditional dances of your community shown in the media? Do the media depictions give an accurate idea of the dances of your community as you experience them?”</specific>

        <specifics>
          <specific>B1.1	engage actively in drama exploration and role play, with a focus on examining multiple perspectives related to current issues, themes, and relationships from a wide variety of sources and diverse communities (e.g., identify significant perspectives related to an issue such as peer pressure, treaty rights, or cultural identity, and assume roles to express the different perspectives; use prepared improvisation to communicate insights about life events and relationships; use thought tracking and symbolic artefacts to present a persona associated with a past historical event)
	Teacher prompt: “What drama conventions (e.g., mime, overheard conversation, a day in the life) could you use to inform the audience about the events leading up to the issue? What roles should be adopted to represent the range of perspectives related to the key themes of our drama (e.g., differing world views of Europeans and Aboriginal people at the time of contact)?” </specific>
          <specific>B1.2	demonstrate an understanding of the elements of drama by selecting and combining several elements and conventions to create dramatic effects (e.g., develop a drama presentation incorporating a series of tableaux, a group soundscape, a movement piece, and a rap/song)
	Teacher prompts: “Which convention will you use to begin the piece? End the piece?” “What roles could be introduced to explore the relationships in more detail?”</specific>
          <specific>B1.3	plan and shape the direction of the drama by working with others, both in and out of role, to generate ideas and explore multiple perspectives (e.g., In role: use thought tracking or writing in role to explore the feelings and motivations of a character; introduce a new perspective during role play to foster a sense of empathy with the character; Out of role: use a place mat activity to select ideas that group members agree upon; use invented notation to explain the movement of the character)
	Teacher prompts: “How could you use the conventions of flashback and flash forward to examine turning points and major decisions in your drama piece?” “How might you physically represent the different emotions experienced by different characters in the drama?”
</specific>
          <specific>B1.4	communicate feelings, thoughts, and abstract ideas through drama works, using audio, visual, and/or technological aids to heighten the dramatic experience (e.g., use music to create mood; use video and drums/noisemakers to signal the climax; use a digital slide presentation to create a backdrop of words or images; use costumes, props, fabric to establish character and/or setting)
	Teacher prompts: “What is different when we develop a drama for a recording studio versus the classroom, a street or mall performance, or an arts night performance?” “How could you use sound technology to help listeners visualize the action of a radio drama?” “How could you use lighting and projection technology to enhance the setting for your stage production?” “What images could you project that would provide a clarifying contrast to the action on the stage?” </specific>

        <specifics>
          <specific>D1.1	create art works, using a variety of traditional forms and current media technologies, that express feelings, ideas, and issues, including opposing points of view (e.g., an acrylic painting that uses symbols to represent conflict and resolution; performance art or an installation that portrays both sides of the struggle between humankind and nature; a mixed-media or digital composition of a personal mandala that shows both unity and opposing forces) 
	Teacher prompts: “How will your art work convey opposing perspectives on an issue that you have chosen to explore (e.g., consumerism versus sustainability, land development versus conservation, global warming, poverty)?” “With the symbols you have chosen, how can you show resolution as clearly as you have shown conflict?” “How does your installation communicate the benefits and challenges of environmental stewardship?” </specific>
          <specific>D1.2	demonstrate an understanding of composition, using multiple principles of design and the “rule of thirds” to create narrative art works or art works on a theme or topic (e.g., use colour [analogous, monochromatic] to unify a montage of newspaper and magazine images and text on a social issue; use smooth, horizontal lines to give a feeling of harmony in a drawing; create a landscape that shows unity, using repetition of shapes, values, textures, and/or lines, a particular area of focus, and the rule of thirds) 
	Teacher prompts: “How will you use colour to unify your art work and convey your message?” “How can you create unity and harmony in your landscape painting by repeating shapes and selected analogous colours?” “How can you lead the eye through the painting using implied directional lines along a diagonal axis?”</specific>
          <specific>D1.3	use elements of design in art works to communicate ideas, messages, and understandings for a specific audience and purpose (e.g., create balance in positive and negative space in a personal logo design, using drawing or paper cut-outs of black-and-white shapes on a grey background; selectively manipulate the colour, values, and text in a digital composition to change the message of a print advertisement)
	Teacher prompts: “How could you elaborate on the visual metaphor in your logo? How could you simplify the design of the logo and still retain a balance between positive and negative shapes?” “How could you change the colours, values, and symbols used in a print advertisement for a popular soft drink to convey an objection to consumerism?” </specific>
          <specific>D1.4	use a variety of materials, tools, techniques, and technologies to determine solutions to increasingly complex design challenges (e.g.,
	- drawing: make a cubist still life of objects with reflective or textured surfaces, using both wet [e.g., ink, watercolour pencils] and dry [e.g., conté, chalk] materials to simulate highlights and transparency 
	- mixed media: make a hand-made or altered book, using various materials and techniques to represent ideas about selected elements in dance, drama, music, and/or the visual arts
	- painting: make a cityscape that will serve as a background in an animated short movie, using experimental watercolour techniques such as wet on wet or salt resist
	- printmaking: make a collograph or chine collé that communicates a personal experience through the use of shape and analogous colour
	- sculpture: make clay or papier mâché gargoyles or “crossed creatures” that have exaggerated features, using open and closed forms
	- technology: make a high-contrast self-portrait or caricature with software, using techniques such as blurring, cloning, cropping, distortion, layering, rotation, and selection)

	Teacher prompts: “What mood do you think is created by the artist in each painting?” “What do you think is the relationship between artistic intent and the expressive work?” “How might others understand this image differently because of differences in age, life experience, culture, or beliefs?” “Why is it important for people to be able to evaluate visual images as a part of daily life?” “How do individual and societal values affect our response to art?” </specific>
          <specific>D2.2	explain how the elements and principles of design are used in their own and others’ art work to communicate meaning or understanding (e.g., the use of complementary colours for shadow detail in a still life by Cézanne; the use of contrast to emphasize the features in a portrait; Brian Jungen’s use of positive and negative space and the colours in traditional First Nation art works to convey ideas about consumerism and culture in masks that he created out of brand-name running shoes)
