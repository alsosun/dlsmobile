        <overall_text>Creating and Presenting: apply the creative process (see pages 19-22) to the composition of simple dance phrases, using the elements of dance to communicate feelings and ideas</overall_text>
        <specifics>
          <specific>A1.1	use movements that are part of their daily experience in a variety of ways in dance phrases (e.g., alter and exaggerate movements based on even rhythms such as walking, galloping, and swimming, and on uneven rhythms such as skipping and jumping; amplify and modify percussive movements such as the movement of a clock ticking or the sustained hold of a cat stretching) 
	Teacher prompts: “What everyday movements do you do throughout the day?” “When you wave hello to a friend who is close by, is your wave bigger or smaller than when the friend is far away? How might you change the action of waving by making the movement bigger/smaller or faster/slower? Will the speed or rhythm of the movement change when you make it bigger or smaller?” </specific>
          <specific>A1.2	use dance as a language to express feelings and ideas suggested by songs, stories, and poems, with a focus on the element of body, particularly body shapes (e.g., use the entire body [crouch, slump] and body parts [folded arms, bowed head] to express an idea such as deep thought)
	Teacher prompts: “Show me with your body how the ogres felt when they encountered the dragon (e.g., depict courage).” “How can you position your body, head, arms, and legs so we can better understand the ideas you want to express?”
</specific>
          <specific>A1.3	create dance phrases using a variety of ways to connect movements (e.g., connect a melt and a spin using a non-locomotor movement; connect a walk and a skip [locomotor movements] with a circle [pathway])
	Teacher prompts: “If you are at a low level and you want to go to a high level (or if you want to go from a high level to a low level), how are you going to get there? Are you going to spin, grow, reach up, melt, rise, or wiggle?” “If you were a seed in the ground, how would you grow into a tree? Would you grow with fast movements or slow?” “In your performance, how can you connect a skip, a fall, and a spin to create a movement sentence (or phrase)?”
</specific>
          <specific>A1.4	use varied and/or contrasting body shapes to communicate different types of messages (e.g., a high level and open, expansive shape to show dominance; a closed huddled shape to show that you are holding a treasured or secret object)
	Teacher prompt: “What body shapes can you use to show you like something? Dislike something? Are there other body shapes to express the same ideas?” </specific>

        <specifics>
          <specific>A2.1	describe differences they observe when various movements from daily life are used as the basis or stimulus for movements in a dance phrase (e.g., describe ways in which everyday actions and movements such as skipping on the playground, walking to school, brushing their teeth, or getting dressed are changed when they are used in a dance phrase)
	Teacher prompt: “How are actions and gestures used to communicate in daily life different from movements that are used to communicate in dance? What would dances be like if the movements were always the same as movements you see in daily life?”
</specific>
          <specific>A2.2	identify and describe how the element of body is used in contrasting ways to communicate ideas in their own and others’ dance phrases, with teacher support (e.g., standing versus kneeling body bases can communicate differences in power; curved versus straight shapes can communicate contrasting emotions)
	Teacher prompts: “What contrasting levels did Sandeep use to show the difference between happy and sad?” “What was Carmen’s body base when she was kneeling? What was she saying with that shape?”</specific>
          <specific>A2.3	identify and give examples of their strengths and areas for growth as dance creators and audience members (e.g., using connecting movements; working collaboratively in groups to create dance phrases incorporating everyone’s ideas; watching peer performances attentively and asking relevant questions)
	Teacher prompts: “How do you come up with ideas for movement?” “How do you incorporate everyone’s ideas when working together?” “What makes a good audience member? When you watch your classmates dancing, do you try to behave as you would like others to behave when they are watching your dance work?” “What differences are there between the way you behave when watching dancing in a theatre versus at an outdoor stadium or a cultural event with your family?”

	Teacher prompts: “How can you and your friends retell the story using puppets?” “How can you and a partner act out how you think the story will end - but without using any words?” </specific>
          <specific>B1.2	demonstrate an understanding of the element of character by adopting thoughts, feelings, and gestures relevant to the role being played (e.g., use facial expressions, body movement, and words to respond in role to scenarios and questions; express different points of view after reading a picture book about issues of belonging and discrimination; work with a partner to create a short scene that shows the importance of acceptance, understanding, and inclusion)
	Teacher prompts: “When I ask you a question as Grandma, how might you answer me as the wolf?” “How can you show (e.g., using gestures) what you are thinking and feeling when you are in role? Try to imagine why the wolf acts the way it does.”</specific>
          <specific>B1.3	plan and shape dramatic play by building on the ideas of others, both in and out of role (e.g., In role: add ideas to the dramatic play that reflect the knowledge and experience of the role that is being played [such as a scientist mentioning an experiment or a journalist mentioning an 
interview]; create and share scenes from their own experiences; Out of role: work in a group to plan and prepare a scene and ask follow-up questions such as “How could we make this clearer? What changes can we make to help our story be understood?”; describe the sort of  person who might own a particular found object such as a bag or a coat)
	Teacher prompts: In role: “What do I need to know about the situation we find ourselves in?” “How might we convince (the main character) to listen to us?” Out of role: “How can you work with your friends to act out a story? What do you think the characters should do?” “Can you introduce a new role in response to ideas emerging in the drama?”</specific>
          <specific>B1.4	communicate feelings and ideas to a familiar audience (e.g., classmates) using a few simple visual or technological aids to support and enhance their drama work (e.g., use a sheer cloth moved quickly to represent water; use a rainstick or shaker to create a sense of mystery or magic; use a variety of classroom objects to create a play area for specific dramatic play experiences)
	Teacher prompts: “How was the character feeling at the end of the story?” “What colours could we use to represent feeling happy? Feeling sad?” “If your character was the weather, what body shapes and props could you use to get into character?”</specific>

          <specific>B2.1	express feelings and ideas about a drama experience or performance in a variety of ways, making personal connections to the characters and themes in the story (e.g., in oral discussion, relate themes about family relationships or friendships to their own lives; after viewing a play or clip of a movie dealing with family issues [such as Cinderella or Princess Mononoke], contribute to a class journal entry or draw a picture to show the feelings of one or more of the characters - a stepsister, Cinderella, the mice) 
	Teacher prompts: “Can you explain how you are different from and similar to your favourite character in today’s drama/read-aloud?” “Does our drama experience make you think about stories we have read? How did the drama make you feel?” “If you could give advice to this character, what would you like to say to him/her?”</specific>
          <specific>B2.2	demonstrate an understanding of how the element of character/role is used in shared classroom drama experiences and theatre to communicate meaning (e.g., to provide important information in a situation; to represent a particular perspective/point of view; to change the direction of the plot; to symbolize an idea such as friendship)  
	Teacher prompts: “What would the story be like if the wise woman didn’t appear to give advice? Should we assume that she is a hero/villain?” “How was the character in the play we saw like a real person?” “How would the story change, if it was told by a different character? Who might be interesting to hear from?”</specific>

          <specific>D1.2	demonstrate an understanding of compo­sition, using principles of design to create narrative art works or art works on a theme or topic (e.g., a drawing of an approaching storm that uses a variety of lines to create contrast [dashed, jagged, curved, spiral]; a cardboard or papier mâché sculpture of a mythical animal in a dynamic pose that uses surface materials to show a contrast in texture [fuzzy yarn; coarse, prickly sawdust])
	Teacher prompts: “How can you vary your lines to create contrast between the area of the image that is the storm and the area of calm?” “How can you use levels and positioning of your sculpture’s limbs and body to compose a sculpture that is visually interesting on all sides and that shows a variety of forms?”</specific>
          <specific>D1.3	use elements of design in art works to communicate ideas, messages, and personal understandings (e.g., a pattern of broken, wavy, and zigzag lines to make the bark of a tree look rough in a drawing; size and arrangement of organic shapes in a painting of flowers to create the impression that the various flowers are at different distances from the viewer)
	Teacher prompts: “What kinds of lines would you use to show this texture?” “Look carefully at the arrangement of these flowers. How do you have to place them and change their shapes in a painting to show that some of them are closer and some farther away?”</specific>

	-mixed media: use torn paper and textured materials to create a landscape collage of a playground that includes a horizon line
	-painting: create paint resists that are made with wax crayon on paper, using rubbing plates that have a variety of textures [e.g., bumpy, wavy] to create imaginary creatures inspired by the artistic style of Eric Carle 
	-printmaking: use cut sponge or cardboard and paint stamping to make a pattern of geometric and organic shapes
