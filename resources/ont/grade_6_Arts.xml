        <overall_text>Creating and Presenting: apply the creative process (see pages 19-22) to the composition of short dance pieces, using the elements of dance to communicate feelings and ideas</overall_text>
        <specifics>
          <specific>A1.1	incorporate the use of props and materials (e.g., fabric, chairs, hats, hula hoops, balls, sticks) into dance pieces they create (e.g., use fabric as a shawl or an extension of an arm gesture or the movement of a ship’s sail; use a stretchy fabric body bag to create abstract shapes; use an artefact like a garbage can to explore rhythm and body movement) 
	Teacher prompts: “When creating a dance, how could you use chairs to explore relationship (e.g., over, in front of, behind), shape, and levels?” “How can you use the prop (e.g., streamer, fabric) as an extension of your body to make shapes, pathways, and lines to emphasize or extend movement?”  </specific>
          <specific>A1.2	use dance as a language to interpret and depict central themes in literature (e.g., develop a movement vocabulary that reinterprets themes such as good versus evil or humans versus nature; construct a dance that explores bravery in a legend or peace in a poem)
	Teacher prompts: “What types of shapes or pathways would you use to communicate frustration?” “How could you use level to depict feelings of freedom or authority?”</specific>
          <specific>A1.3	use guided improvisation in a variety of ways as a starting point for choreography (e.g., use exercises such as mirroring, flocking, and body storming to create movement material for choreography)
	Teacher prompt: “How can a guided improvisation like flocking expand your movement vocabulary?”</specific>
          <specific>A1.4	combine the elements of dance in different ways to communicate a variety of ideas (e.g., combine a low level and a wavy pathway to show evasion; use the sudden, quick, and indirect movements of a dynamic orchestra conductor and translate them into a whole body expression of the music)
	Teacher prompts: “What elements could you combine to show that you are on a dangerous mission?” “What elements could you combine to show that you are excited? Or bored?”

        <specifics>
          <specific>A2.1	construct personal interpretations of dance pieces that depict stories, issues, and themes, and explain their interpretations, using dance terminology (e.g., write an opinion paragraph on a recorded or live community dance performance [Red Sky]; write a response journal entry on a dance piece performed by peers about a social issue [emotional or physical bullying, friendship, safety, fairness, family, inclusion, equity]) 
	Teacher prompts: “How do we know this dance is about bullying? What elements helped make the theme clear?” “What did this dance mean to you? What themes or stories did you see in it?” </specific>
          <specific>A2.2	analyse, using dance vocabulary, how the elements of dance are used in their own and others’ dance pieces and explain how they help communicate messages and ideas (e.g., pairing free-flowing movements with slow music suggests a dreamy mood; using low levels and quick, short movements suggests busyness; using symmetry and asymmetry conveys the idea of change or transformation)
	Teacher prompt: “What elements did the dancers use to communicate joy/surprise? Were the ideas clearly communicated through movement? What does the dancing suggest that couldn’t have been expressed in another way?”</specific>
          <specific>A2.3	identify and give examples of their strengths and areas for growth as choreographers and audience members (e.g., determine how their preparations for a performance improved the performance and what they might do differently to strengthen future performances) 
	Teacher prompts: “What skills do you need to be a choreographer? How can you hone these skills?” “How could you use a movement web to generate more ideas for your next dance?”

          <specific>A3.1	describe, with teacher guidance, types of dances used among Aboriginal peoples in the past and the present that express aspects of their cultural identity (e.g., dances to express prayers and/or gratitude; initiation dances to mark rites of passage; shamans’ dances to assist in physical or spiritual healing; contemporary powwow dances for cultural affirmation and/or revitalization)

</specific>
          <specific>B1.2	demonstrate an understanding of the element of role by selectively using other elements (e.g., time and place; relationship; tension) to build belief in a role and establish its dramatic context (e.g., develop a character in the context of a courtroom drama: judge, lawyer, witness, juror, the accused)

          <specific>B1.4	communicate feelings, thoughts, and ideas to a specific audience, using audio, visual, and/or technological aids to strengthen the impact on the viewer (e.g., use a data projector to project evocative imagery; use filters and gels to create unusual effects with lighting; use music to suggest a mood; use masks to highlight specific character traits) 
	Teacher prompts: “What features of your mask have you exaggerated to allow the audience to see the character from a distance (e.g., heavy brows, large nose, large eyes, jutting chin)?” “How can you use a photograph or everyday object from another historical period to communicate an aspect of that person/time/place?” “What visual effect would emphasize what this character is feeling on the inside?”</specific>

What else could you repeat to create rhythm?” “How can you use small areas of brilliant, warm colour to visually balance large areas of either neutral or cool colours?”

	-drawing: use charcoal to create a shaded drawing of the exaggerated details of a face, a figure, or natural objects [e.g., shells, pods] on earth-toned papers [e.g., tan construction paper]    
	- mixed media: create a collage that uses a limited colour palette by cutting, pasting, and layering to combine images, symbols, textured papers, and text about consumerism or cultural pride 
	- painting: use a variety of paint techniques [e.g., blending, scumbling, glazing] in a mural of a landscape or cityscape incorporating stylistic elements from contemporary pop culture 
	- printmaking: cut and gouge a variety of lines and marks to enhance the background and negative spaces in a softoleum, linoleum, or block print that depicts an endangered animal species
