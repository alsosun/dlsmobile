          <specific>A1.1 Using Listening  Comprehension Strategies: identify a range of listening comprehension strategies and use them appropriately before, during, and after listening to understand oral French texts (e.g., identify familiar words and phrases and frequently used expressions; use contextual and/or visual clues in oral texts, including the speaker’s body language and tone of voice, to confirm or clarify meaning; activate prior knowledge and make connections to personal experiences to confirm understanding; ask questions to obtain additional information; visualize, sketch, or draw to record information and ideas)
Teacher prompts: “Quels sont les mots familiers du texte qui t’aident à comprendre le message?” “Comment est-ce que les images t’aident à clarifier le sens du texte?” “Quels sont les mots et les expressions dans le texte qui t’aident à visualiser?”</specific>
          <specific>A1.2  Demonstrating Understanding: demonstrate an understanding of the purpose and meaning of oral French texts containing familiar words and expressions about everyday topics and situations, with contextual and visual support (e.g., follow classroom directions; follow a series of Total Physical Response [TPR] commands; sequence a group of pictures or images for a storyboard, based on a description; make drawings to illustrate objects in an oral description; find a specific classroom object by following directions from the teacher and class; identify refrains, rhyme schemes, and other word/sound patterns in songs, poems, read-alouds, chants, and rhymes; listen to a description and identify the object described)
Teacher prompts: “Qu’est-ce que tu as compris de l’histoire ou de la description? Montre-moi.” “Comment est-ce que tu peux démontrer ta compréhension de la description d’un objet/d’un animal/d’une personne?”
