          <specific>1.1 identify a range of purposes for listening in a variety of situations, formal and informal, and set goals appropriate for specific listening tasks (e.g., to analyse the arguments on both sides of a class debate; to create a character sketch based on a sound clip from a film or an audiotape of an interview; to synthesize ideas in a literature circle)</specific>
          <specific>1.2 demonstrate an understanding of appropriate listening behaviour by adapting active listening strategies to suit a wide variety of situations, including work in groups (e.g., take turns without interrupting or overlapping during a class debate or panel discussion; ask questions to make connections to the ideas of others; use vocal prompts in dialogue to express empathy, interest, and personal regard: After an experience like that, I can imagine how you felt.)</specific>
          <specific>1.3 identify a variety of listening comprehension strategies and use them appropriately before, during, and after listening in order to understand and clarify the meaning of increasingly complex or challenging oral texts (e.g., use background knowledge about the structure of oral texts such as debates, interviews, speeches, monologues, lectures, and plays to make predictions and identify important ideas while listening; ask questions for clarification or further information; visualize scenes suggested by evocative or descriptive language in a text; use note-taking strategies to keep track of or summarize important points made by a speaker)</specific>

          <specific>1.5 develop and explain interpretations of oral texts using stated and implied ideas from the texts to support their interpretation 
Teacher prompt: "Explain what evidence you used to determine the theme(s) in this oral text." </specific>
          <specific>1.6 extend understanding of oral texts, including increasingly complex texts, by connecting, comparing, and contrasting the ideas and information in them to their own knowledge, experience, and insights; to other texts, including print and visual texts; and to the world around them (e.g., activate prior knowledge in order to assess the credibility of a speaker's assertions; assess the validity of other speakers' ideas in relation to their own and modify their own ideas if appropriate; compare the information or ideas in an oral text to those in another text on the same topic)</specific>
          <specific>1.7 analyse oral texts in order to evaluate how effectively they communicate ideas, opinions, themes, or experiences, and suggest possible improvements (e.g., listen to two sides of an argument in a debate, make a judgement, and develop a personal position on the topic)</specific>
          <specific>1.8 explain the connection between a speaker's tone and the point of view or perspective presented in oral texts (e.g., the reason why a speaker might employ humour to present a serious theme) 
Teacher prompts: "How does the use of humour in this text influence the audience?" "Why do you think the speaker uses sarcasm? Is it effective? Why, or why not?" </specific>

          <specific>2.2 demonstrate an understanding of appropriate speaking behaviour in most situations, adapting contributions and responses to suit the purpose and audience (e.g., ask questions and paraphrase to confirm understanding; request repetition or an explanation from other group members when meaning is unclear; use language and forms of address that are appropriate to the formality or informality of the situation) </specific>
          <specific>2.3 communicate orally in a clear, coherent manner, using a structure and style appropriate to both the topic and the intended audience (e.g., use a formal structure of opening statement, enumeration of points, and summary/conclusion, and a straightforward, impersonal style, to present a position statement on an issue) 
</specific>
          <specific>2.4 use appropriate words, phrases, and terminology from the full range of their vocabulary, including inclusive and non-discriminatory language, and a range of stylistic devices, to communicate their meaning accurately and engage the interest of their intended audience (e.g., use the technical vocabulary of the subject area during a scientific investigation in a group setting; incorporate literary language and structures into personal anecdotes or imaginative narratives; use emotive language in a persuasive appeal to a large group)</specific>

          <specific>1.1 read a wide variety of increasingly complex or difficult texts from diverse cultures, including literary texts (e.g., short stories, poetry, novels, mysteries, historical fiction, autobiographies, scripts, lyrics), graphic texts (e.g., graphs and graphic organizers, charts and tables, diagrams, surveys, maps), and informational texts (e.g., print and online encyclopedias, manuals, and magazine and newspaper articles; magazines in their first languages, where appropriate; electronic texts, textbooks, and non-fiction materials; a variety of dictionaries, thesauri, and websites)</specific>
          <specific>1.2 identify a variety of purposes for reading and choose reading materials appropriate for those purposes (e.g., an electronic database listing magazines, newspapers, and journals to verify information; a national, local, or community newspaper for coverage of a specific/current issue; scripts and lyrics for enjoyment, recreation, and interest; an online or print encyclopedia article for background information) </specific>
          <specific>1.3 identify a variety of reading comprehension strategies and use them appropriately before, during, and after reading to understand increasingly complex texts (e.g., activate prior knowledge on a topic through dialogue and discussion; use visualization and comparisons with images from other media to clarify details of characters, scenes, or concepts; ask questions to monitor understanding; summarize sections of text during reading; synthesize ideas to broaden understanding)</specific>
          <specific>1.4 demonstrate understanding of increasingly complex texts by summarizing important ideas and citing a variety of details that support the main idea (e.g., key information in manuals, surveys, graphs, online and print encyclopedias, websites, tables and charts; theme and related ideas in magazine articles, dramatic monologues, television programs)</specific>

          <specific>1.6 extend understanding of texts, including increasingly complex or difficult texts, by connecting the ideas in them to their own knowledge, experience, and insights, to other familiar texts, and to the world around them (e.g., by comparing their own perspective to those of the characters in a historical novel) 
Teacher prompt: "How is the immigration experience of these characters similar to that of new arrivals today? How is it different?"</specific>
          <specific>1.7 analyse a variety of texts, both simple and complex, and explain how the different elements in them contribute to meaning and influence the reader's reaction (e.g., narrative: having ordinary characters caught up in an exciting plot makes the story seem more real; debate: the formal, balanced structure encourages the reader to pay equal attention to both sides of the argument) 
Teacher prompts: "What does the author do to engage our sympathy for the main character? Why do you think the author makes us wait to find out what happens to this character?" "Does reading about another point of view make you think about this issue differently?" </specific>
          <specific>1.8 evaluate the effectiveness of both simple and complex texts based on evidence from the texts
