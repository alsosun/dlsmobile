        <specifics>
          <specific>1.1 identify purposes for listening in a few different situations, formal and informal (e.g., to hear the sounds of language in songs, chants, and poems; to interact socially with classmates; to enjoy and understand a story read aloud by the teacher; to follow simple directions in large- and small-group settings; to exchange ideas with a peer in a paired sharing or small group) </specific>
          <specific>1.2 demonstrate an understanding of appropriate listening behaviour by using active listening strategies in a few different situations (e.g., listen without interrupting and wait their turn to speak; show that they are paying attention and are interested by looking at the speaker, nodding, or asking relevant questions) 
</specific>
          <specific>1.3 identify a few listening comprehension strategies and use them before, during, and after listening in order to understand and clarify the meaning of oral texts, initially with support and direction (e.g., use background knowledge, familiar word order, and context to make predictions about content or vocabulary before listening to an oral text; think about what known words might be related to the topic; ask questions to check understanding during and after listening; create mental pictures while listening to a read-aloud and draw or talk about what they visualized; retell the important information presented in a class discussion or a think-pair-share activity) 
</specific>
          <specific>1.4 demonstrate an understanding of the information and ideas in oral texts by retelling the story or restating the information, including the main idea (e.g., use time-order words, such as first, then, next, finally, to retell a story they have heard; restate information from a movie about community workers, including a topic statement and several supporting details) </specific>
          <specific>1.5 use stated and implied information and ideas in oral texts, initially with support and direction, to make simple inferences and reasonable predictions (e.g., attend to the words being spoken and also use personal experience and the speaker's intonation and facial expression to understand what is being said) Teacher prompt: "The boy said, 'You broke my airplane!' What helps you understand how he might be feeling? What do you think he might do next?" </specific>
          <specific>1.6 extend understanding of oral texts by connecting the ideas in them to their own knowledge and experience; to other familiar texts, including print and visual texts; and to the world around them (e.g., make personal connections between their own ideas about a topic and the ideas in an oral text; identify other texts that have similar elements or content) 
</specific>
          <specific>1.7 identify words or phrases that indicate whether an oral text is fact or fiction, initially with support and direction (e.g., a personal recount might start "Last year in the summer holidays..." while a fictional story might start "Once upon a time...") </specific>
          <specific>1.8 begin to identify, with support and direction, who is speaking in an oral text and the point of view expressed by the speaker (e.g., the narrator may be a character in a story or an expert on the topic of an informational talk; the speaker may be recounting a personal anecdote or sharing a personal opinion) 
Teacher prompts: "Who is telling this story/presenting this information? What words/clues helped you figure that out?" "What do we know about the speaker?" "How might the story be different if another character were telling it?" 
</specific>
          <specific>1.9 begin to identify some of the presentation strategies used in oral texts and explain how they influence the audience (e.g., the use of differences in tone and pitch for different characters in a story; the use of props to engage the audience) 
Teacher prompts: "How did the speaker use his/her voice to make you like/not like a character?" "Why do you think the speaker used the puppets when he was speaking?" </specific>

          <specific>2.2 demonstrate an understanding of appropriate speaking behaviour in a few different situations, including paired sharing and small- and large-group discussions (e.g., give other group members an opportunity to speak; respond positively to the contributions of others; stay on topic and speak to the point) </specific>
          <specific>2.3 communicate ideas and information orally in a clear, coherent manner (e.g., use a logical framework such as a beginning, middle, and end sequence to retell a story read aloud by the teacher)
</specific>
          <specific>2.4 choose appropriate words to communicate their meaning accurately and engage the interest of their audience (e.g., choose words relevant to the topic from the full range of their vocabulary, including new words used regularly in the classroom; use descriptive adjectives to clarify and add interest to a narrative; use inclusive language that conveys respect for all people)
</specific>
          <specific>2.5 begin to identify some vocal effects, including tone, pace, pitch, and volume, and use them appropriately to help communicate their meaning (e.g., increase volume to emphasize important points or to communicate to a large audience) </specific>
          <specific>2.6 identify some non-verbal cues, including facial expression, gestures, and eye contact, and use them in oral communications, appropriately and with sensitivity towards cultural differences, to help convey their meaning </specific>
          <specific>2.7 use one or more appropriate visual aids (e.g., pictures, photographs, props, puppets, masks) to support or enhance oral presentations (e.g., use a set of plastic animals during an oral recount about a visit to a zoo)

Why did...?; identify important ideas in a text) 
Teacher prompt: "What do you think is the most important thing to remember so far about this text/topic? Why do you think it is important?"
