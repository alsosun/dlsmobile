        <specifics>
          <specific>A1.1	imitate movements found in their natural environment in a variety of ways and incorporate them into a dance phrase (e.g., modify the movements of animals, snow falling to the ground, ice melting, plants growing; connect a series of insect-like movements together to make a phrase)
	Teacher prompt: “How would the quality of your movements change if you were first moving like a bee and then moving like a butterfly [erratic, gliding]? Would your movements change to sharp and sudden, or smooth and slow? Would your path be direct and gliding or indirect and meandering?”</specific>
          <specific>A1.2	use dance as a language to represent ideas from diverse literature sources, with a focus on time and energy (e.g., interpret stories, poems, and texts from other subject areas through dance; respond to a story about insects by depicting the sustained lifting and pulling actions of ants versus the sustained floating actions of butterflies)
	Teacher prompts: “When creating a dance phrase to represent the idea of this poem, consider the poem’s punctuation. How would you express the dance equivalent of an exclamation mark for emphasis in the dance?” “Which combination of elements will you choose from the time and energy chart to portray the rest of the insect characters in the story?” </specific>
          <specific>A1.3	create dance phrases using a variety of pattern forms (e.g., create dances with distinct, self-contained sections that share movement qualities using AB form, ABA form, or ABBA form; demonstrate a pattern physically by making “A” a soft and fluid section and “B” a fast and percussive section)
	Teacher prompt: “How would you show the water cycle using a pattern in dance? Which pattern form can you use to convey your idea?”</specific>
          <specific>A1.4	demonstrate how dance elements can be used to create and expand the movement vocabulary within different sections of a larger pattern (e.g., A: varying the use of space while marching quickly; B: changing levels while waving arms slowly; A: varying locomotor and non-locomotor percussive movements while marching quickly)
	Teacher prompt: “In an ABA form, how can you vary your gestures and movements to make the A section distinctly different from the B section?”</specific>

          <specific>A2.1	demonstrate an understanding of how the elements of dance can be used in their own and others’ dance phrases to illustrate or explore learning in other subject areas (e.g., show and explain how the elements of body and relationship can be used to depict the science concept of magnetic attraction)
	Teacher prompts: “Kofie’s choice to start his dance in a small shape was meant to show he was a seed. How did that information help us predict his ending shape?” “What similarities/ differences can you see between the patterns we used in our dance and the patterns we used in math?”</specific>
          <specific>A2.2	identify, using dance vocabulary, the elements of dance used in their own and others’ dance phrases and explain their purpose (e.g., the use of body, space, time, and energy to create variety and interest; the use of levels, relationship, pathways, and shape to emphasize a mood; the use of canon, direction, grouping contrast, and repetition to explore pattern)
	Teacher prompts: “Which two patterns did we use? Why did we use different patterns?” “How did Antonio’s actions help us know how he was feeling?” </specific>
          <specific>A2.3	identify and give examples of their strengths and areas for growth as dance creators and audience members (e.g., share with a partner what they did well; write in a journal about what they need to improve) 
	Teacher prompt: “What did you do well, or what would you change next time about your dance (or your use of the creative process)?”</specific>

          <specific>A3.1	describe, with teacher guidance, a variety of dances from communities in Canada and around the world that they have seen in the media, at live performances and social gatherings, or in the classroom (e.g., dance numbers in animated movie musicals such as Happy Feet and Ice Age; First Nation dances at a powwow; folk dances of the early settlers; the farandole of France)
	Teacher prompts: “When you viewed the sailor’s hornpipe, did you see interesting dance movements or patterns that you would like to include in your own dance pieces? Can you describe or demonstrate some of them?” “Can you describe some of the ways in which STOMP uses garbage can lids, brooms, basketballs, and ladders as dance props?” “Can you describe how the dance you experienced with the visiting artist is similar to dance work we have done in class?”

        <specifics>
          <specific>D1.1	create two- and three-dimensional works of art that express personal feelings and ideas inspired by the environment or that have the community as their subject (e.g., make a symmetrical sculpture of an insect or a flower, using natural materials such as wood, pebbles, dry seed pods, feathers; draw a picture depicting a solution to the problem of litter in their community; make a painting of nature, focusing on a feature of personal interest or meaning to themselves) 
	Teacher prompt: “Let’s look at how artist Andy Goldsworthy uses natural materials in his art. How can you use the textures and shapes of sticks, leaves, or stones to express your ideas about the natural environment?” </specific>
          <specific>D1.2	demonstrate an understanding of compo­sition, using principles of design to create narrative art works or art works on a theme or topic (e.g., use shapes of various sizes, in the foreground, middle ground, and background, to create an illusion of depth [perspective] in a painting about a make-believe world; create a mural to express a response to a community celebration, using a variety of lines and shapes; using a scratchboard that has a layer of various colours covered by india ink, make a high-contrast line drawing about a story by scratching the black surface to reveal the colours beneath the surface) 
	Teacher prompts: “How can you vary the thickness of lines to make your characters stand out from the background?” “How can you use colours to show your feelings about the places in your mural?”</specific>
          <specific>D1.3	use elements of design in art works to communicate ideas, messages, and understandings (e.g., use asymmetrical cut-paper composite shapes to depict a Canadian landscape, with a clear 
foreground, middle ground, and background; use colour values and shapes in a “What’s inside me?” painting in the X-ray style of Norval Morrisseau to create contrast between the inside and the outside of the figure) 
	Teacher prompts: “When creating a sense of space in your landscape, should you create 
the foreground, middle ground, or background first? Why?” “What colour choices did you make to create more or less contrast?” “Why do you think Tom Thomson chose to paint a windswept tree in The Jack Pine instead of a symmetrical tree? How can you use asymmetry in your own art work?”</specific>
          <specific>D1.4	use a variety of materials, tools, and techniques to respond to design challenges (e.g.,
	-drawing: use a variety of lines and shapes, drawn with pencil and marker, to show movement in a flipbook about weather 
	-mixed media: use wax crayons, oil pastels, paint resist, and materials of various textures [e.g. yarn, found objects] to depict a tree or plant above ground, and use the technique of elaboration to depict what is hidden below ground 
	-painting: create a watercolour or tempera painting of animals, using colour in a non-representational and expressive way 
	-printmaking: paint stencil prints in warm and cool colours, creating a simplified pattern inspired by a favourite fruit 
	-sculpture: use modelling clay to create organic forms that are inspired by nature, such as shells, seed pods, and water-worn stones, and that show some kind of metamorphosis or transformation into another form or figure) 
	Teacher prompts: “How can you make the shapes move more smoothly in your flipbook? Would small or big changes in movement between one page and the next work better to create smoothness?” “What do the roots of a tree or plant look like below the ground? How could you draw a plant and show its roots?” “How does the emotional impact or mood of your print change when it is printed in warm instead of cool colours?” </specific>

	Teacher prompts: “What words will you choose to express your feelings about the exhibition in your poster?” “Using what you know about the artist, and looking carefully at the art work, what might the artist have said about his or her artistic choices?” </specific>
          <specific>D2.2	explain how elements and principles of design are used to communicate meaning or understanding in their own and others’ art work (e.g., colour value in Emily Carr’s Indian Church; organic shapes to make the monsters look less frightening and more like stuffed animals in Where the Wild Things Are by Maurice Sendak)
	Teacher prompts: “What do you think this painting is about? What elements has the artist used to make the painting’s message clear?” “What design elements has Sendak used on this book’s cover? How have images, shapes, colours, and the letters of words been arranged on the cover to send a clear message?”</specific>
          <specific>D2.3	demonstrate an awareness of the meaning of signs and symbols encountered in their daily lives and in works of art (e.g., fonts or logos that remind them of specific companies, messages, or moods; the meaning of animals such as the orca in Aboriginal clan symbols or the Inukshuk in Aboriginal art)
