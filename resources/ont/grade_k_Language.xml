          <specific>4. use language in various contexts to connect new experiences with what they already know (e.g., contribute ideas orally during shared or interactive writing; contribute to conversations at learning centres; respond to teacher prompts) [A] 
Student Talk: “I made a sandcastle like this at the beach.” “I built a snowman with my brother like the one in the story.” </specific>
          <specific>5. use language to talk about their thinking, to reflect, and to solve problems [A]
