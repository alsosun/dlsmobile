          <specific>1.1 identify a range of purposes for listening in a variety of situations, formal and informal, and set goals related to specific listening tasks (e.g., to understand learning strategies modelled by the teacher during think-alouds; to develop a response to a commentary on an issue; to share information and ideas about a topic with peers during conversations, discussions, and meetings; to become familiar with and appreciate the sounds of different types of poetry) 
		</specific>
          <specific>1.2 demonstrate an understanding of appropriate listening behaviour by adapting active listening strategies to suit a range of situations, including work in groups (e.g., ask questions to clarify understanding before responding; affirm and build on the ideas of others; summarize and respond constructively to ideas expressed by others; use brief vocal prompts to signal agreement or interest during conversations: Yes; Say that again, please; Tell me more)</specific>
          <specific>1.3 identify a variety of listening comprehension strategies and use them appropriately before, during, and after listening in order to understand and clarify the meaning of oral texts (e.g., ask questions about facts, inferences, and value judgements to focus and clarify understanding of the themes in an oral text; summarize and synthesize ideas to deepen understanding of an oral text; use self-questioning and predict questions that might be asked to monitor understanding while listening)</specific>
          <specific>1.4 demonstrate an understanding of the information and ideas in oral texts by summarizing important ideas and citing a variety of supporting details (e.g., summarize an episode of a favourite television program for a small group; summarize the ideas in a book read aloud to the class) </specific>
          <specific>1.5 make inferences about oral texts using stated and implied ideas in the texts as evidence (e.g., ask questions to generate inferences about an oral text: What would happen if...? I wonder what was meant by...?)</specific>
          <specific>1.6 extend understanding of oral texts by connecting the ideas in them to their own knowledge, experience, and insights; to other texts, including print and visual texts; and to the world around them (e.g., relate the content of an oral presentation to that of books, articles, movies, television shows, or videos on the same topic; discuss issues related to the topic of an oral text; use role play and drama to explore ideas, emotions, or issues presented in oral texts)</specific>
          <specific>1.7 analyse oral texts and explain how specific elements in them contribute to meaning (e.g., ideas and information, word choice, tone of voice, pace of delivery, body language)

          <specific>1.8 identify the point of view presented in oral texts and ask questions to identify missing or possible alternative points of view (e.g., use drama or role play to explore the perspective of the minor characters in a play; respond to a speaker who expresses an alternative point of view on an issue; ask a variety of people for their views about a topic) 
Teacher prompts: "How would the content of this text change if it were presented from a different point of view?" "How would the language the author uses need to change to reflect a different point of view?" "What other voices do you think should be heard on this topic?" "Is the text fair?"</specific>

          <specific>3.4 produce a variety of media texts for specific purposes and audiences, using appropriate forms, conventions, and techniques (e.g.,
